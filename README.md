## Overview

This repository contains my best Transact-SQL (T-SQL) queries and scripts developed for the "Safety At Work" database project. The scripts demonstrate my ability to write clear, efficient SQL code for real-world business scenarios, including compliance reporting, safety analysis, and employee training tracking.
